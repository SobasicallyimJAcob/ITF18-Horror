Comments:

You need to have someone edit this for basic syntax and grammar errors. At the very beginning, we have you not capitalized
at the beginning of a sentence and friend spelled freind. In a text based game, your text really matters.

The dying seems awfully quick. I die walking in the rain from the bus to the house?

Some more gramatical/spelling errors in the house. I see ]ining room(2). Your group should be proofreading this.

I washed the gear but the clock still says it's still too grimey.

After you die, make sure you leave a way to quite the game and not keep looping it.

Overall, the game was definitely playable and could be quite good with some more polishing.
